# Spindump Command Usage

## Introduction

The software is packaged as the "spindump" utility, and simply typing

    # spindump 
 
should show the most active sessions and their current round-trip times (RTTs). The top of the screen shows some status information, while the rest is dedicated to showing connections and their RTTs. You can exit from the tool by pressing Control-C or "Q". In addition, you can use "C" to toggle whether to show closed connections, "U" to whether to show UDP connections, or "A" to show either individual connections or aggregated connections. Pressing "H" shows help information and pressing "S" enables you to set the screen update frequency.

The full command syntax is

    spindump [options] [filter]

If no options or filter is specified, Spindump will look at all packets on the default interface. The filter specification is as specified in other PCAP-based tools such as tcpdump. See the man page for pcap-filter(7) for more details.

## Examples

To simply start the Spindump tool on the default user interface is enough for most cases:

    # spindump 

To look at specific connections, you can enter a filter specification. For instance, the expression "icmp" tracks only ICMP packets, and the expression "tcp and host www.example.com" tracks TCP packets where www.example.com appears either as a source or destination address. So, for instance:

    # spindump udp and port 443

would only look udp port 443 traffic (likely QUIC).

To use Spindump in a textual mode, without screen updates, use

    # spindump --textual

or

    # spindump --textual --format json 

This would then output events from the observed traffic to stdout.

Alternatively, if one wants to send data from a measurement point somewhere else, one can do:

    # spindump --remote http://example.com/data/1

Where example.com is the place where the reports are sent, "data" is a fixed part of URI where POSTs will be made, and "1" is a part of the URI that identifies from where the data is from. For more information about these conventions, see the [format description](https://github.com/EricssonResearch/spindump/blob/master/Format.md).

## Options

The options are as follows:

    --silent
    --textual
    --visual

Sets the tool to be quiet as it measures (--silent), listing RTT measurements as they become available (--textual) or continuously update the shell window with information about the current sessions (--visual). The default is --visual. The --silent option also sets the tool to publish information about connections it sees on a local port (5040) that can be connected to by other instances of Spindump.

    --format text
    --format json

For the textual mode, the output format is selectable as either readable text or JSON. Each event comes out as one JSON record in the latter case.

    --anonymize-left
    --not-anonymize-left
    --anonymize-right
    --not-anonymize-right
    --anonymize
	--not-anonymize

These options are used to control the amount of anonymization that Spindump does. Anonymization can be turned on or off either for hosts whose traffic is displayed, or for hosts on the "left" or "right" side of the in-network measurement point. "Left" side is defined as the traffic initiating the connection. And the "right" side is defined as the traffic from the responder.

    --names
    --addresses

Sets the tool to use always addresses (--addresses) or when possible, DNS names (--names) in its output. The use of names is the default.

    --report-spins
    --not-report-spins
    --report-spin-flips
    --not-report-spin-flips

Sets the tool to either report or not report individual spin bit values or spin bit value flips for QUIC connections, when using the --textual mode. The default is to not report either the spin values (as there is one per each packet) or spin value flips.

    --report-rt-loss
    --not-report-rt-loss
    --report-qr-loss
    --not-report-qr-loss
    --report-ql-loss
    --not-report-ql-loss

 Sets the tool to either report or not report round-trip loss rates, QR loss rates or QL unidirectional loss rates for QUIC connections based on three experimental algorithms, when using the --textual mode. The default is to not report packet loss rates.

    --report-packets
    --not-report-packets
    --report-notes
    --not-report-notes

The first two options set the tool to either report statistics on every packet or not. Note that --report-spins also sets reporting for all packets, but only for QUIC flows. The second two options set the tool to either report the textual "note" field on JSON or textual outputs or not.

    --debug 
    --no-debug
    --deepdebug
    --no-deepdebug
    --deepdeepdebug
    --no-deepdeepdebug

The first pair sets the debugging output on/off. Note that in the visual or textual output modes, all debugging information goes to the file spindump.debug in the current working directory. The second and third sets the extensive or very extensive internal debugging output on/off.

    --average-mode
    --no-average-mode
    --aggregate-mode 
    --no-aggregate-mode 

The --average-mode option causes the tool to display (or report in output or HTTP-delivered update) average values instead of specific instantaneous values. Default is to report instantaneous values. The  --aggregate-mode option causes the tool to display (or report) aggregates only, not individal connections. The default is to report individual connections.

    --filter-exceptional-values n

This option makes Spindump do filtering of exceptionally small or large values. The argument is a percentage value, from 0 to 400 percent. It expresses what percentage of current standard deviation should be considered as exceptional. For instance, if the standard deviation of RTT values is 10, then setting this option to 20 makes values that stand out more than two times the standard deviation as exceptional. Exceptional values are still reported as RTT measurements and taken into average calculations, but not taken into account when calculating the filtered average.

    --bandwidth-period n
    --report-only-periodically n

The first option sets the measurement period for bandwidth. Each connection is measured for bandwidth in periods, with the number of bytes sent on a connection during that period counted together. Bandwidth numbers are always presented in bytes/s but when traffic varies over time, a shorter measurement period will produce a more variable bandwidth numbers, whereas a longer period will produce a smoother measurement. The option takes an argument, the length of the period in microseconds. The default is 1000000 or 1s. The second option is only applicable when Spindump is not run in visual mode. It will then make only periodic reports every n seconds. The default is 0, which means that Spindump makes reports of statistics whenever relevant events happen, i.e., when statistics change.

    --no-stats
    --stats

The option --stats makes Spindump provide various levels of final statistics once the process completes. The default is --no-stats.

    --aggregate [tags] [default] pattern1 pattern2

Track the aggregate traffic statistics from host or network identified by pattern1 to host or network identified by pattern2. These can be individual host addresses such as 198.51.100.1 or networks such as 192.0.2.0/24. In addition, pattern2 can be of the form networkfile:FILE which causes networks to be read from FILE. FILE should contain one network prefix per line in CIDR notation. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported. An easy way to specify any connection to a network is to use a 0-length prefix. For instance, to track all connections to 192.0.2.0/24, use the option setting "--aggregate 0.0.0.0/0 192.0.2.0/24". You may  also optionally add "tag" information to be used for the aggregate and reported in any outputs from Spindump. The format of a tag is tag1=... tag2=... and any number of tags may be included. Finally, if you include "default" before the patterns, that indicates that this rule should only be matched if no other rule matched. This allows traffic to be classified, for instance, to some known prefixes and the rest.

    --tag t

Tag all Spindump-created connections with the given tag t, which is an arbitary string (but may not include a comma, as that is used to separate tag values from each other). Any number of tags may be provided.

    --max-receive n

Sets a limit of how many packets the tool accepts before finishing. The default is 0, which stands for no limit.

    --interface i
    --snaplen n
    --input-file f
    --json-input-file f

The --interface option sets the local interface to listen on. The default is whatever is the default interface on the given system. Arguments "lo" and "any" are supported. The --snaplen option is used to control how many bytes of the packets are captured for analysis. The --input-file option sets the packets to be read from a PCAP-format file. While reading a PCAP-format file, Spindump ignores the --snaplen option. PCAP-format files can be stored, e.g., with the tcpdump option "-w". Finally, the --json-input-file option can be used to give Spindump a JSON output produced by another Spindump run.

    --remote u
    --remote-block-size n
    --collector-port p
    --collector 
    --no-collector 

The --remote option sets software to submit connection information it collects to another Spindump instance running elsewhere with the --collector option specified. The machine where the other instance runs in is specified by the URL u, e.g., "http://example.com:5040/data/1". By default, Spindump uses the port 5040, which is reflected in the URL. The path component "data" is required when submitting data to another Spindump instance, and the path component "1" is simply an identifier that distinguishes different submitters from each other.

As noted, the collector is turned on by using the --collector option. On the collector side the port can be changed with the --collector-port option. Also, a given Spindump instance running as a collector can accept connections from multiple other instances. The Spindump instance that is running as a collector will not listen to the local interfaces at all, only the collector port.

Finally, the --remote-block-size option sets the approximate size of submissions, expressed in kilobytes per submission. Multiple individal records are typicallly pooled in one update, but if the block size is set to 0, there will be no pooling. The format of the submissions is governed by the --format option.  Note that only the machine readable formats are actually processed by the Spindump instance running as a collector; --format text will be ignored by the collector. The formats are specified in the [data format description](https://github.com/EricssonResearch/spindump/blob/master/Format.md)
